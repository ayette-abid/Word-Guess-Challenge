# Word-Guess-Challenge
university project


The program generates a random 8-letter word, and the player has 7 attempts to guess it. 

After each attempt, the program provides feedback on how many letters are correct and well-placed, and how many are correct but misplaced.

The game continues until the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.
